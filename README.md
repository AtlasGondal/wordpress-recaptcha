# WordPress ReCaptcha Plugin

The WordPress ReCaptcha plugin integrates Google's reCAPTCHA service into your WordPress site to help protect your site from spam and abuse. It can be used for login forms, comment forms, and other areas where user-generated content is created.

## Features

- Adds Google reCAPTCHA to the WordPress login form.
- Adds Google reCAPTCHA to the comment submission form.
- Validates reCAPTCHA responses to ensure that content is submitted by humans, not bots.
- Easy to set up with your Google reCAPTCHA keys.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the release page.
2. Go to Plugins page, and click on Add New
3. Select Upload, and choose `wordpress-recaptcha.zip` file
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
5. Navigate to the plugin settings under `Settings > Wordpress ReCaptcha` in the WordPress admin area.
6. Enter your Google reCAPTCHA site key and secret key. If you don't have these keys, [register your site with Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) to get them.

## Usage

Once the plugin is activated and configured with your reCAPTCHA keys:

- A reCAPTCHA box will be automatically added to your WordPress login and comment forms.
- Users will need to complete the reCAPTCHA challenge before submitting the forms.
- The plugin will verify the reCAPTCHA response with Google to ensure the submission is legitimate.

## Customization

Currently, the plugin automatically applies Google reCAPTCHA to the login and comment forms without additional customization options. Future versions may include more customizable features.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the plugin, please ensure that:

- You have entered the correct site key and secret key in the plugin settings.
